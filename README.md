# GraphQL Server Example

This example shows how to implement a **GraphQL server with TypeScript** based on [Photon.js](https://photonjs.prisma.io/), [apollo-server-micro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-micro) and [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Clone the `prisma2-example` repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:xuybin/prisma2-example.git
```

Install Node dependencies:

```
cd prisma2-example
npm install
```


### 2. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

### 3. Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./src/schema.graphql`](./src/schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

#### Retrieve all published posts and their authors

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Create a new user

```graphql
mutation {
  signupUser(
    data: {
      name: "Sarah"
      email: "sarah@prisma.io"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Create a new draft

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "Join the Prisma Slack"
    content: "https://slack.prisma.io"
    authorEmail: "alice@prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

#### Publish an existing draft

```graphql
mutation {
  publish(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Search for posts with a specific title or content

```graphql
{
  filterPosts(searchString: "graphql") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Retrieve a single post

```graphql
{
  post(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Delete a post

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteOnePost(where: {id: "__POST_ID__"})
  {
    id
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.
